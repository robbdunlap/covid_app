Data are reported to state and jurisdictional health departments in accordance with applicable state or local law and in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-laboratory-data-reporting-guidance.pdf\">CARES Act Section 18115</a>).</p>\n<p>Data are <strong>provisional and subject to change</strong>.</p>\n<p>Data presented here is representative of diagnostic specimens being tested - not individual people - and excludes serology tests where possible. Data presented might not represent the most current counts for the most recent 3 days due to the time it takes to report testing information. The data may also not include results from all potential testing sites within the jurisdiction (e.g., non-laboratory or point of care test sites) and therefore reflect the majority, but not all, of COVID-19 testing being conducted in the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong> CDC COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (CELR), Commercial Laboratories, State Public Health Labs, In-House Hospital Labs</p>\n<p>Data for each state is sourced from either data submitted directly by the state health department via COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting (CELR), or a combination of commercial labs, public health labs, and in-house hospital labs. Data is taken from CELR for states that either submit line level data or submit aggregate counts which do not include serology tests.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-diagnostic-laboratory-testing-pcr-testing-time-series-data-dictionary\">COVID-19 Diagnostic Laboratory Testing (PCR Testing) Time Series Data Dictionary</a></p>\n",
