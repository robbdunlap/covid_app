The actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) is much higher than reported through official websites. The US lacks an effective, coordinated testing campaign to determine the true extend of the number of infections in the country. Knowing the extent of the disease is important for informing the development of effective policy to halt the spread and lessen the impact. An alternate method to estimate the true extent of the infection is to use the numbers of infections that must have occured to result in the number of deaths observed. This calculation uses the estimated "[Infection Fatality Rate] (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854v4)" (IFR) for SARS-CoV-2. A significant flaw of this method is that the IFR has been dropping (fortunately) over the course of the infection due to improvements in medical treatments. We have not attempted to correct for the change in the IFR which means we are underestimating the total spread of the disease (possibly by as much as 5-fold). This is still a much better estimate than the we get from the reported data.
