The below graphs show how well test positivity correlates with the estimated number of new infections per week. This is useful because the estimated infection data will always be two weeks behind the current date. The estimated infection data lags because it calculates the number of infections that had to have occured two weeks previous to result in that number of deaths. The test positivity data is useful for understanding the current trajectory of the disease, but for many state the data in current week is always low - I don't know the cause but I see the pattern is consistent.
