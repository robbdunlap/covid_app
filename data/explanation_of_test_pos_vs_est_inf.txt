The below graphs are a visual representation of the correlation between the test positivity rate and the estimated number of new infections per week. This is useful because the estimated infection data will always be at least two weeks behind the current date. The estimated infection data lags because it calculates the number of infections that had to have occured two weeks previously to have resulted in the number of deaths in the current week. If the test positivity data correlates well with the estimated infections per week, then it can give you confidence that the latest published test postivity data will reflect the actual trend of the disease in that state. One major caveat - for most states the most recent week is always very low. I don't know the cause but I see that the pattern is consistent. I recommend ignoring the latest week's data in the graph for test positivity.
