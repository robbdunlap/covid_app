The below graphs show how well test positivity correlates with the estimated number of new infections per week. This is useful because the estimated infection data will always be two weeks behind the current date. The estimated infection data lags because it calculates the number of infections that had to have occured two weeks previous to result in that number of deaths. If the test positivity data correlates well with the estimated infections per week, then it can give you confidence that the latest published test postivity data will reflect the actual trend of the disease in the state. One major caveate - for most states the current week is always very low. I don't know the cause but I see that the pattern is consistent.
