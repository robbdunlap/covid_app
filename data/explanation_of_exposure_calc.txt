Estimating daily exposure rates for individuals has been greatly facilitated by the advent of mobile device location reporting. Googleâ€™s Community Mobility Report (Google, 2020) reports the average amount of time people in each state in the US spend in one of six different activity bins:

- Grocery and pharmacy
- Parks
- Transit stations
- Retail and recreation
- Residential
- Workplaces

This information, in conjunction with estimates of the rate of close contact with other individuals in those activity bins, allows the estimation of the number of times a day a person could come into close proximity with an infected person or contaminated objects.
